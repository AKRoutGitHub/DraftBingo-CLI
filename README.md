# 🏆 Ultimate Bingo Race (CLI)

A dynamic, multiplayer Bingo game built in Python. Unlike traditional Bingo, players strategically **draft** their numbers from an available pool, ensuring no two players have the same ticket.



## 🚀 Features
* **Interactive Player Setup:** Supports any number of players.
* **Unique Number Drafting:** A "Master Pool" logic ensures that once a number is picked, it's gone!
* **Live Drawing Engine:** The computer draws numbers with a built-in delay to build suspense.
* **Win Condition:** The first player to reach a set number of matches wins the game.
