# 🏆 Ultimate Bingo Race (CLI)

A dynamic, multiplayer Bingo game built in Python. Unlike traditional Bingo, players strategically **draft** their numbers from an available pool, ensuring no two players have the same ticket.



## 🚀 Features
* **Interactive Player Setup:** Supports any number of players.
* **Unique Number Drafting:** A "Master Pool" logic ensures that once a number is picked, it's gone!
* **Live Drawing Engine:** The computer draws numbers with a built-in delay to build suspense.
* **Win Condition:** The first player to reach a set number of matches wins the game.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python_game.git](https://github.com/AKRoutGitHub/DraftBingo-CLI.git)

## ✨ New Updates (V1.1)
I have recently added the following enhancements to improve gameplay:

- **Robust Error Handling:** Added input validation loops to prevent the game from crashing when users enter non-numeric values.
- **Dynamic Leaderboard:** The CLI now renders a real-time score tracker after every draw, so players can see how close their opponents are to winning.
- **Customizable Ticket Sizes:** Players can now decide how many numbers they want to manage (Minimum 2).
